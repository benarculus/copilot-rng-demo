# copilot-rng-demo
A GitHub Copilot demo using a Python random number generator, providing basic exercises to try out GitHub Copilot functionality. 

## Setup
Locally clone this repo, and open `rng.py` in your IDE with GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat. 

## Demo Script


1. **Chat Prompting:** You've opened up new and unfamiliar code, so start by having GitHub Copilot Chat describe the code found in `rng.py`. In GitHub Copilot Chat ask: `Describe the code in this file`. 
2. **Copilot Edits:** Since there are no comments, let's add some with the help of Copilot. Switch from Chat mode to Edit mode, ask `Add comments to my code`, and accept the suggestions. 
3. **Code Completion::** It would be nice to know if the random number is odd or even. Let's start by adding a comment with what we want to acheive in `rng.py`, `Check if the number is odd or even`, then tab accept code completion recommendations.
4. **Code Review:** The script looks good to me, but let's get some feedback. Select the code in your editor, click on the your code actions icon, select review code. There should be a recommendation to store the random number as a variable. *[As of writting this is only availble in VS Code and GitHub.com]*
